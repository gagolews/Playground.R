A few handy R and Rcpp functions:

* `replicate2()` -- a version of `replicate()`+`vapply()`+a nice progress bar
* `sample2()` -- a version of `sample()` which doesn't treat scalar `x` as `1:x`
* `cgal_qp_solver()` - an interface to the Quadratic (and Linear) programming
solver from the `CGAL` library
* `deskew()` -- an image deskewer (apply, e.g., on the MNIST handwritten
digits dataset)
